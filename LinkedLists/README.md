# LinkedLists Concepts
## OutLine
1. Discussion about Single & Doubly linked lists
   - What is a linked List ?
     - A Linked list is a sequential list of nodes that hold
       data which point to other nodes also containing data.
       node  -->   node  -->  node  -->  node  -->  node
       data1       data2      data3      data4      data5
